Questions:

What does the Pearson correlation coefficient measure? Identify one example value from the correlation table you compute and explain why it makes sense.

The Pearson’s correlation coefficient measures linear correlation between two variables. Between -1 and 1, -1 indicates negative correlation, while 1 indicates positive correlation. One example is total_rooms and total_bedrooms has a correlation of 0.9. It makes sense, because the fact that there are more rooms has to do with number of bedrooms.

Submit your solutions to tasks 1–2. Include the features you selected for task 1 and the synthetic features you developed for task 2; include the final RMS errors but not the training output. Did you beat the Google-provided baselines?

Task 1
- 
#
# Your code here: add your features of choice as a list of quoted strings.
#
minimal_features = [
    "median_income",
    "total_rooms"
]


minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

#
# Don't forget to adjust these parameters.
#
train_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)


My RMSE was 181.11, while Google's RMSE was 165.49

Task 2

training_examples["dist_from_SF"] = abs(training_examples["latitude"] - 38)
validation_examples["dist_from_SF"] = abs(validation_examples["latitude"] - 38)

minimal_features = [
    "median_income",
    "rooms_per_person"
]



minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

_ = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.01,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=selected_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=selected_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

My RMSE was 182.13 while Google's was 182.80
