It incorporates a function called sigmoid, which measures values from 0 to one in order to caluclate the probability.


Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.
	LogLoss seems to affect confidence errors more than L2 Loss does. Whilr L2 loss is not able to differentiate between the difference of log loss and square loss.
	
Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.

Comparing those two was persoanlly hard for me since logistic regression and linear regression deal "loss" in a different way. 


Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
linear_classifier = train_linear_classifier_model(
    learning_rate=0.0000005,

    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

   Validation set AUC: 0.69
   Validation AUC: 0.76
