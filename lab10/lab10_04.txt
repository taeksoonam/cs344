a) In general, we would use linear model than deep NN model when we find a strong linear correlation between variables. Deep NN model takes much longer time, while linear model takes
relatively shorter time than deep NN model.

b) For this specific example, deep NN model runs more efficiently than linear model does, which is aboug 85% to 77%.

c) For sentiment analysis, embeddings do make sense, because in problems like measuring the review, it is computationally efficient. 
All the words are not being used in measuring the review. And using embeddings improved the results as well.

d) "good" and "great" have similar embeddings because they both have positive connotation and tend to be used in argumentative contexts.

e) I have increased the hidden_units to [20,20].
