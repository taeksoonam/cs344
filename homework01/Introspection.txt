I guess the way to see introspection would be different. Introspection by itself has a subjective connotation, 
and thus it is prone to bias, which then will not be able to provide concrete data to properly implement human cognitive process.
However, if we happen to have millions of observations and find patterns among those data, then it seems reasonable to inform AI efforts to 
clone human cognitive process.
