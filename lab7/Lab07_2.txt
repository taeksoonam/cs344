a)
	Categorical data is usually considered when the data come in as text-based or groups that cannot be averaged or calculated. Specific examples would be race, sex, or age.
	On the other hand, numerical data consist of variables that can have mean, sd. Those type of data can be calculated and be treated as numbers.

b) 
	1) train_model(
		    learning_rate=0.00002,
		    steps=800,
		    batch_size=3
		)

		RMSE: 178.50

	2) train_model(
		    learning_rate=0.00002,
		    steps=800,
		    batch_size=3
		    input_feature = "population"
		)

		RMSE: 189.04

c) The guide informs us that hyper-parameters are: learning rate, steps, and batch size. It also informs us that there is no rules of thumbs or standards that can be applied, since the effects of those hyper-parameters are really dependent on the data. Hence, the user has to be aware of the data and test different methods to find the ideal hyper-parameter rates.
