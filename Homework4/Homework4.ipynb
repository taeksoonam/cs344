    "Speculate on whether you believe that so-called “deep” neural networks are destined to be another bust just as perceptrons and expert systems were in the past, or whether they really are a breakthrough that will be used for years into the future. Please give a two-to-three-paragraph answer, including examples to back up your argument.\n",

    "Overall, I believe \"deep\" neural networks can be the start of the breakthrough that can be used in the future. \n",
    "While there are some features that still have to be improved, such as investigating on how neural networs work to give out the results, \n",
    "it can eventually be a breakthrough that can be used for years into the future.\n",

    "With its ability to discover own pattern in complex and sophisticated model or data, \n",
    "Neural network has been proven as a powerful tool to solve real-world problems. \n",
    "For example, I was recently exposed to Uber's new open source technology called Ludwig. \n",
    "It basically creates own categories of emitions in language and also able to cateogrizes images.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, expert systems often are not able to deal a big dataset, because it creates its own rule. \n",
    "Therefore, when the data size gets massive, it has a difficulty of time trying to create all the rules and giving out the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, people have seen how neural networks can help solve real-world problems. \n",
    "By such finding, we may consider deep neural network to be seen as a new type of solution that is going to affect human society a lot. \n",
    "However, as I have mentioned above, there are also improvements that have to be made in neural networks."
